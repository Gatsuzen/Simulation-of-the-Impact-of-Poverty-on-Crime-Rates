#  Simulation of the Impact of Poverty on Crime Rates

This project explores how poverty levels influence crime rates through data simulation and analysis. Using Python, it models the relationship between income distribution and crime occurrence to identify statistical and visual trends.

##  Objectives

1. **Define and calculate poverty**  
   - Identify individuals below a user-defined income threshold.

2. **Calculate crime rates**  
   - Compute overall crime rates and compare them between poor and non-poor groups.

3. **Compare crime distributions**  
   - Apply the **Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test** to check if crime rate distributions differ significantly.

4. **Visualize the relationship**  
   - Plot average crime rates across different income levels to observe trends.

##  Features

- Simulated population dataset with income and crime data.  
- Statistical comparison using the **KS Test**.  
- Data visualization using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.  
- Simple, self-contained code that can be reused for social or economic studies.
